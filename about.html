  In My HTML/CSS 1 class we learned the basics of web development. <br/> <br/>
  
  At the end of class, we had to create a final project based on a prompt.
  
 The prompt was: "Think of an old technological device such as desktop computers, telephones or aeroplanes, and conduct research on how this device has changed from its original creation to the present day and what you believe it will look like in the future. <br/> <br/>
 
 I chose to do vehicles, because, I have an interest in them. In my website, users will learn more about vehicles in the past, present and what I believe they will look like in the future. <br/> <br/>
 
 Enjoy navigating this site! <br/> <br/>
